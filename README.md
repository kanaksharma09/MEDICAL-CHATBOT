# MEDICAL-CHATBOT
This project is a medical chatbot powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain and Hugging Face. It allows users to ask health-related questions and get accurate, context-aware answers from a custom knowledge base. The system uses semantic search with FAISS and a transformer-based QA model to ensure reliable and grounded responses.
